The hardware part is a custom wristband that consists of a computing unit, a wireless communication unit, and an inertial sensor. The software part is an algorithm based on recurrent neural networks that is able to process the signals coming from the sensor and to return a prediction. To validate the system, a dataset consisting of 25 symbols drawn with the arm is collected. These symbols are performed by 33 subjects. We conduct two evaluations:\nperformance evaluation for arm gesture recognition, user recognition and verification usability assessment of the system. The performance of the three recognition tasks indicate that this system can be reliably applied in real environments with an accuracy above 96% for gesture recognition, an accuracy of about 85% for user identification, and an equal error rate of about 13% for user verification. The outcome of the usability test proves a great satisfaction from the users in terms of high simplicity in the use of the wristband and goodness of the machine learning predictions.\n","date":1661170380,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661170380,"objectID":"bbb86d08b5f779af3dbcf19e038488bb","permalink":"/projects/uwear/","publishdate":"2022-08-22T14:13:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/projects/uwear/","section":"projects","summary":"A paper exploring using LSTMs and other recurrent architectures to do various gesture recognition tasks.","tags":["DeepLearning","Publications"],"title":"U-WeAr: User Recognition  on  Wearable  Devices  through  Arm  Gesture","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Alberto Raimondi"],"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents What is Org-mode Why Org-mode How I use Org-mode General inbox Dotfiles management Reading list Blog writing Work journal Personal scheduling Personal wiki Searching Tables System documentation Paper publishing Tips and Tricks Org mode on the go Git integration Agenda speedup Why not Org-mode Where to start In the software enthusiasts world, org-mode does not need any presentations, everyone has at least heard someone singing its praises as the end-all organizational software. Initially, I did not see the appeal, to me it was just an alternative to markdown syntax with some utilities on top, nothing that a good editor and a couple of scripts could not emulate. I tried to find some examples on the web about why org-mode is considered so awesome and but I found very specific posts that would go deep in a very specific feature or very general ones using org-mode as a simple markdown alternative. After a lot of experimentation and more than a year of using it to organize all sorts of stuff, I decided to write this article to show you what actually is that makes org-mode so amazing.\nWhen I started my journey into the personal organization space I found a lot of proponents of the GTD method, and after a brief introduction to it, I found it a good start to base my organizational habits on. The GTD method is pretty simple and can be summarized in a couple of paragraphs, even if some people like to overcomplicate it to make it a one size fit all system the basic of GTD is to note down everything that you need to do and organize when to do it while keeping some periodic review to clean up things. It is not my intention to delve deep into GTD and its infinite variations that people like to proselytize about, mainly because it is not the focus of this article but also because I think that you have to build your system by yourself piece by piece to make it fit your own way of thinking. The good news is that in this article I‚Äôm talking about how I use org-mode to build this system for myself and hopefully you will be able to take inspiration from this and build your own system.\nWhat is Org-mode Org mode is a major mode for the Emacs text editor. Emacs is one of the two most regarded text editors in the world and along with Vim is one of the most debated pieces of software between software engineers. The philosophies of Vim and Emacs are polar opposites and while Vim focuses on being a fast and minimal text editor, Emacs focuses on being totally extensible. The extensibility of Emacs is totally unique in the software world, no other editor or program is as flexible and this is because Emacs is really an interactive programming environment that runs a text editor. A skilled elisp programmer can transform Emacs in whatever he wants with very few limitations on the result.\nAs a result of this extensibility, a lot of different systems are built on Emacs and they are able to interact together in a way that even after years of usage seem magical. The most incredible extension of the Emacs ecosystem is Org-mode. Org-mode is a system that allows for writing, outlining, scheduling, time tracking, publishing, and much more under a single paradigm and makes the interaction between these different tasks intuitive.\nWhy Org-mode Org-mode is one of those things that is really hard to explain and you really have to see it in action to understand its power. When I talk to people about how I use org-mode they often can‚Äôt understand the advantages of the system and feel like other systems do what org-mode does but better. This is true in the specific cases, for example:\nthe markdown ecosystem is much more developed than org-mode for publishing content and taking notes calendar tools are more effective at scheduling appointments graph notetaking tools are more immediate at constructing complex graphs of information Jupyter notebooks are better to share pieces of code The problem with this line of reasoning is that these tools are extremely isolated: taking notes about a calendar appointment always leads to the note and the appointment being un-linked. Publishing a blog post written in markdown is fast but you often leave it on the website that you have to manually visit to get back. Constructing a graph in roam is effective until you have to manually copy files and pdf text to cite and link resources together. The advantage that org-mode has over all these tools is that you can access all these functions together in a way that allows their interaction to give back much more value for your organizational needs. In addition to the power of org-mode, you also have all your files in a textual format that can be easily integrated with a VCS like Git to track history and can be synced using software like Dropbox or Syncthing to make it available on all your devices. Lastly working with org-mode files is blazing fast, you don‚Äôt have to wait for any browser page to load and if you are used to vim you can enable evil mode giving ‚Ä¶","date":1634126280,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634126280,"objectID":"40c56c702b85d3d925bca601dd135797","permalink":"/posts/taking_control_of_your_life_with_org_mode/","publishdate":"2021-10-13T13:58:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/posts/taking_control_of_your_life_with_org_mode/","section":"posts","summary":"An overview of how I use Emacs Org-mode to stay on top of things.","tags":["organization","tools"],"title":"Taking control of your life with org mode","type":"posts"},{"authors":["Alberto Raimondi"],"categories":null,"content":"In this project, I helped researchers of Universit√† Degli Studi di Milano Statale to implement a fully automatic image segmentation model working with 2D, 3D, and 4D data.\nThe implemented model was a U-net architecture for medical image segmentation based on the nnUNet project.\nThe results of this project are being used to research the possibility of automating craniofacial MRI and CT scans to improve the speed with which doctors can access meaningful patient analysis results.\nFigure 1: An example of the resulting segmentation of a human abdomen.
